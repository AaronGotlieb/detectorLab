Image Processing in IDL using FITS images
Image processing is an important part of being an astronomer. Luckily, there are a
ton of procedures that have already been written that you can use. The most widely used
package of astronomy routines is the NASA IDL astron library, which is distributed by
Goddard Space
ight Center. Think of this as an expansion pack of .pro les that adds new
procedures and functions to IDL.
